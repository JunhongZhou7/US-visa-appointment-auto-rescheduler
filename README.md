US visa rescheduler (current version for Canadian user & non-Immigrant application only, ideal for Us visiting VISA)

What the program does:
  -for applicants of USA visa who needs to take an appointment for interview, this program refreshes available dates for each consular locations every 10 seconds.
  -once an available date is found, it compares with the current registered date --> reschedules for that date is more recent than the current one, discards otherwise.
  -then it selects the first available time slot (since there aren't many available anyways)

Why is this program useful:
  -the average wait time to get your interview appointment is around 20 months. 
  -By constantly refreshing the reservation page, this program automatically locks the most recent appointment on the scheduel that appears, which significantly reduces wait time.

What you need to run the program:
  -Chrome Driver for your version of Chrome 
  -having paid for your appointment and have already scheduled one already
  -open your chrome in debug mode
  -if you would like an email notification, the app password from your choice of email
